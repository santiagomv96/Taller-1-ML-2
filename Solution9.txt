UMAP is a way to reduce the dimension of a data set, taking them from a high level and whit graph teory 
making a geometrical figure wich is on a KNN model, this figure is called varity, and keep the structure
and relasionship between de features, this varity will be used to transform the features on a smaller
information plain, it is optimized by descensed gradient method using de shanon entroy as a error measure
